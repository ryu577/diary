Had a dream today. Yesterday, I changed the pedals of my mountain bike to orange ones. In the dream, I was driving the mountain bike around. 
But then I noticed (in some kind of parking lot) the pedals were black. And I was like "this doesn't make sense, I just changed the pedals yesterday". Then the pedals, while
remaining black started morphing into fancier, newer looking pedals with footstraps. And then I woke up. It was like I had caught someone in a lie.
