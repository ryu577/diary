Plato quote:
They get bored in childhood and hurry to grow up. But then they miss their childhood.
- I actually promised myself that I would always be a kid. That I wouldn't change my core.
They lose their health to earn money. But they pay money to regain their health
- Health is the most valuable asset we have. Don't compromise on it. Exercise everyday, eat healthy, eat less.
Worried about tomorrow, they forget about today. In the end, they live neither today nor tomorrow. 
They live as if they will never die. But they die as if they had never lived.

Don't have the most, but need the least.

I brought the expensive bicycle. It was on sale 6.8k. Now I have to get reimbursed for everything.

8807 SW Marseilles Dr Beaverton OR 97007

I'll order it to Pulkit's house and then ride back from there. Ask Pukit about this when he visits.
