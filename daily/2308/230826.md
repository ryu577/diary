Air quality terrible yesterday, today and next few days. Watched Oppenheimer movie yesterday. After that, got into vicious Youtube cycle. Dropped Mac in black restroom and screen got cracked. This anxiety caused me to sleep late, around 3:30. Even though I slept till 11, I feel horrible, don't feel like taking any initiative, etc. Sleep is very important. It helps prevent cancer and makes our days more productive. It is a no-brainer. Every night should be a great sleep night.
- Always aim to sleep before midnight.
- NEVER watch youtube after 11 PM. No matter the day.
- Try to eliminate screen time after 11 PM and just plan for the next day.
- NEVER watch youtube on Mac or PC. Only on Ipad and phone.
	- This might mean not checking channel analytics on mac. Use IPad for this. There is a dedicated app which will prevent me from getting sucked into endless videos.
	- Another option is to go to studio.youtube.com and never youtube.com. And when you do go there, never a reason to spend more than 15 mins. So, the app timer still applies.

Trying to get an estimate of how much Apple will charge for screen repair. Case no: **102076929573**
