Taking Flix bus to Portland. Took 245 and then 545. Arrived at the Seattle stop very smoothly and without incident.

Was eating wild blackberries at the bus stop and a lady told me they spray them with pesticide. Apparently blackberry bushes provide habitat for foxes. That's their crime. 

For the bus back from Portland to Seattle, all busses on the schedule: 2120 have bike racks.
