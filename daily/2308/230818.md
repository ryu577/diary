## Obsidian like app
Looked into how to build an Obsidian like app. Turns out, they use Electron: https://www.electronjs.org

On the way back, the tyre of my new Canyon bike ruptured on the road. Thankfully, this was close to the house and I could just walk back. I took it to REI immediately to continue having a working bicycle. They changed the tyre to a 32mm (from 28 mm). This increased the weight of the bike. Now, with the padded seat, pedals and new fatter tyre, the weight is 7 kg. This was unacceptable, so I removed the padded seat and decided to wear the padded bike trunk.

On removing the padded seat, the weight is 6.7kg.

Weight of existing pedals: 129 gm each.

Later, I might get the original tires in order to reduce weight: https://www.amazon.com/SCHWALBE-Triathlon-Tubeless-Folding-Evolution/dp/B07WZFNJQZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3S2EOUF7NTIKO&keywords=Schwalbe%2BPro%2BOne%2BTT%2C%2B28mmm&qid=1692561732&sprefix=schwalbe%2Bpro%2Bone%2Btt%2C%2B28mmm%2Caps%2C213&sr=8-1&th=1&psc=1.
