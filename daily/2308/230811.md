Just completed Portland to Seattle bike ride with my new 6 kg Canyon bike.

This was a plan executed to perfection. I'm getting better and better at planning and executing. This is a crucial skill.

Wednesday
- Took the bus to Seattle ([[Ticket-Seattle-Wa-Portland-Or-3097692304.pdf]]). At Portland station, took train to Beaverton transit center. Before train came, got protein box from Target. It had 2 boiled eggs, some biscuits and peanut butter. It was the first meal of that day. Quite delicious.
- Took a bus from the transit center and then walked 40 mins to Pulkit's house. 
	- Was solving the problem of $\lambda$ for Shanim's model while waiting for the bus at Beaverton transit center.
	- Had Apples on the way directly from trees. Had dinner with Pulkit (pasta and salad). Gave his kids a Rubicks cube set.
- Pulkit went upstairs to put his kids to sleep. After a while, I found my way to his garage and started taking out the bicycle, cutting the packaging.
- Pulkit came down after a while and was looking at some Trek Madone and other bikes on Craigslist.
- We spoke about Ghare and his dad and how Ghare has quit applied and had gone back to India, taking work politics too seriously.
- Finally, around 11:45 or so, Pulkit started helping me assemble the bike.
- We were done with the assembly a little after 12.
	- Found out I didn't have Fitbit charger.

Day-1 (8/10)
- Set out Thursday from Pulkit's house around noon.
	- His nanny commented that the seat should have more cushion.
- Tried to fill air in the tires with the small pump. Damaged the back tire valve a bit. All the air leaked out. Thought the trip is over and what to do now.
	- Then, figured out how to fix the valve and operate the pump in a stable manner. Filled the back tyre up to a passable level.
- Arrived at Safeway in Longview around 6:34 PM.
	- Was seriously considering taking public transit. There was a train (Amtrack) to Centralia.
	- In about 1.5 hours, decided to forge ahead with the plan.
- Set out again a little before 8 PM (7:55?). Sun was just beginning to set.
- Arrived at King Oscar motel around midnight (ate 2 burgers from burger king along the way).
Day-2 (8/11)
- Breakfast around 8:15 AM
- Set out at 8:55 AM.
- Chose the shorter route. Got to Joint base Lewis McChord. But the road was locked by a gate. Contemplated jumping the gate with bike. The other path led directly to the freeway.
	- Picked some blackberries around the fence.
- Thought I'd have to go to the freeway (405 N). But on going forward a bit, Google maps recommended an alternate route.
- Started feeling a cut in my bum (the metal seat had cut it) and a cramp in my right foot. Thankfully discovered it didn't hurt that much if I left the saddle. So, last 50 miles, riding off the saddle. Every time a down-hill section came, got aero, didn't pedal and conserved energy.
- At Tukwila, reached my old friend, the Interurban trail. Lovely views of mount rainier.

- Reached Bellevue around 6:30 PM. Was heading home. Got a call from Aerin. She was at Bellevue square. So, I cut the ride there and went to the mall. Had Jamba juice with Mira and Aerin. Then dinner of Poke and lamb roll outside the mall.

The song that kept spinning in my head "tere bin mera mann".

Qn: What bags was I wearing?
I had the frame bag for my bike.
I had the fanny bag (big one). I remember that caused stomach cramps after I drank a lot of juice.
Did I have the green bicycle bag? It was ordered on July 30. So I probably had it.

- A diary is personal. It doesn't belong on any cloud. It should be yours.
- A diary shouldn't need an internet connection to build. 
- A diary should leverage all the data we are collecting with modern technology on our phones.
	- Use the data not for corporations, but ourselves.
- A diary shouldn't require a monthly subscription to build.
	- Rich and poor should be able to use it.
- Good images can be generated by AI now. But it was never about the images. Its the context and story behind them.
- If Anne Frank could write a diary, most people should.
	- Encourages documenting the past. Hence, makes for a better future.
