Things I'm proud of:
- Finding that distribution of null doesn't matter ~2019
	- This happened before Mira was born but I was in the new house. Probably around September 2019, a month before Mira's birth.
- Estimating $\pi$ using a wealthy gamblers race
- Estimator of median and percentiles based on exponential distribution
- Coupon collectors problem variance when unequal probabilities using Poisson trick from Ross.
- Path cover solution to env des problem (when AzQ was starting).
- Making a fundamental code improvement to scipy. 
	- The motivation happened when Mira was in Seattle children's hospital for the second time and Jayjit pinged me saying the binom test was leading to memory errors when running for AIR_BP. Only happened for two sided version. This would have been around summer 2020 maybe?
	- Here, I developed an alternative more efficient version based on binary search but sat on it for a long time. I finally pushed it to scipy 
- Creating C# library for Groebner basis.
- Visualizations of 4-d cube opening.
