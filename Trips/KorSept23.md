Ended up going to Seoul despite lots of mind-changing from Aerin.
- Went to the coastal city of Sokcho. Stayed there at Lotte hotel.
- Close to Incheon was the planned city of Songdo. Kind of like New York. Tall buildings, central park.
- Went to a ski resort in the summer. Weather up on the mountain was quite pleasant.
