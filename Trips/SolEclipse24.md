We should purchase a portable telescope (Hestia): https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vaonis/hestia-turn-your-smartphone-into-a-smart-telescope?ref=2rt4fq&gclid=CjwKCAjw5remBhBiEiwAxL2M94fEN1clhl35qtqpy1tsvCnyS0_qw_iETzFln3Fies0_t1vcM1XGRRoCt60QAvD_BwE

Look into buying this in January.

1.7mil of 10k pledged. So they will likely still be around in January.
At that point, eclipse will still be 3 months away.

Uvalde seems to have the highest chance of clear weather as well.

Looks like I'll need a bicycle bag and figure out how to pack my bicycle and Mira's seat into it.
